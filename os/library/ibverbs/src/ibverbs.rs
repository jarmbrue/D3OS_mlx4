// Copied from rust-ibverbs 0.8.1

//! Rust API wrapping the `ibverbs` RDMA library.
//!
//! `libibverbs` is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA "verbs" to perform
//! high-throughput, low-latency network operations for both Infiniband (according to the
//! Infiniband specifications) and iWarp (iWARP verbs specifications). It handles the control path
//! of creating, modifying, querying and destroying resources such as Protection Domains,
//! Completion Queues, Queue-Pairs, Shared Receive Queues, Address Handles, and Memory Regions. It
//! also handles sending and receiving data posted to QPs and SRQs, and getting completions from
//! CQs using polling and completions events.
//!
//! A good place to start is to look at the programs in [`examples/`](examples/), and the upstream
//! [C examples]. You can test RDMA programs on modern Linux kernels even without specialized RDMA
//! hardware by using [SoftRoCE][soft].
//!
//! # For the detail-oriented
//!
//! The control path is implemented through system calls to the `uverbs` kernel module, which
//! further calls the low-level HW driver. The data path is implemented through calls made to
//! low-level HW library which, in most cases, interacts directly with the HW provides kernel and
//! network stack bypass (saving context/mode switches) along with zero copy and an asynchronous
//! I/O model.
//!
//! iWARP ethernet NICs support RDMA over hardware-offloaded TCP/IP, while InfiniBand is a general
//! high-throughput, low-latency networking technology. InfiniBand host channel adapters (HCAs) and
//! iWARP NICs commonly support direct hardware access from userspace (kernel bypass), and
//! `libibverbs` supports this when available.
//!
//! For more information on RDMA verbs, see the [InfiniBand Architecture Specification][infini]
//! vol. 1, especially chapter 11, and the RDMA Consortium's [RDMA Protocol Verbs
//! Specification][RFC5040]. See also the upstream [`libibverbs/verbs.h`] file for the original C
//! definitions, as well as the manpages for the `ibv_*` methods.
//!
//! # Library dependency
//!
//! `libibverbs` is usually available as a free-standing [library package]. It [used to be][1]
//! self-contained, but has recently been adopted into [`rdma-core`]. `cargo` will automatically
//! build the necessary library files and place them in `vendor/rdma-core/build/lib`. If a
//! system-wide installation is not available, those library files can be used instead by copying
//! them to `/usr/lib`, or by adding that path to the dynamic linking search path.
//!
//! # Thread safety
//!
//! All interfaces are `Sync` and `Send` since the underlying ibverbs API [is thread safe][safe].
//!
//! # Documentation
//!
//! Much of the documentation of this crate borrows heavily from the excellent posts over at
//! [RDMAmojo]. If you are going to be working a lot with ibverbs, chances are you will want to
//! head over there. In particular, [this overview post][1] may be a good place to start.
